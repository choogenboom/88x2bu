### DKMS:
This driver can be installed using DKMS. DKMS is a system utility which will automatically recompile and install a kernel module when a new kernel is installed. To make use of DKMS, install the `dkms` package. On Debian (based) systems, such as Ubuntu and Mint, installation is accomplished like this:
```
$ sudo apt-get install dkms
```

Note: The installation of `dkms` in Mint or Ubuntu will result in the installation of the various development tools and required headers, if not previously installed, so no addition action is necessary on these distros.

### Installation of the Driver:

Note: The installation instructions I am providing are for the novice user. Experienced users are welcome to alter the installation to meet their needs.

Note: The quick way to open a terminal in Mint or Ubuntu: Ctrl+Alt+T (hold down on the Ctrl and Alt keys then press the T key.)

Note: My technique is to create a folder in my home directory to hold source packages. I call it `src`.

Create a folder to hold the downloaded driver file by first opening a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T).

In the terminal, create the folder to hold the driver file:
```
$ mkdir src
```

Get the latest version of the driver from: `https://github.com/morrownr/88x2bu`

Download the driver by clicking on the green `Code` button.

Click on `Download ZIP` and save `88x2bu-master.zip` in your `src` folder.

Upzip `88x2bu-master.zip`. A folder called `88x2bu-master` should be created.

Open a terminal and enter the folder called `88x2bu-master`:

```
$ cd ~/src/88x2bu-master
```

Execute the following commands:
```
$ sudo ./dkms-install.sh
```
```
$ sudo reboot
```
### Removal of the Driver:

Open a terminal in the directory with the source code and execute the following commands:
```
$ sudo ./dkms-remove.sh
```
```
$ sudo reboot
```

### Entering Monitor Mode with 'iw' and 'ip':
Start by making sure the system recognizes the Wi-Fi interface:
```
$ sudo iw dev
```

The output shows the Wi-Fi interface name and the current mode among other things. The interface name will be something like `wlx00c0cafre8ba` and is required for the below commands. I will use `wlan0` as the interface name but you need to substitute your interface name.

Take the interface down:
```
$ sudo ip link set wlan0 down
```

Set monitor mode:
```
$ sudo iw wlan0 set monitor control
```

Bring the interface up:
```
$ sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```

Verify the mode has changed:
```
$ sudo iw dev
```

### Reverting to Managed Mode with 'iw' and 'ip':

Take the interface down:
```
$ sudo ip link set wlan0 down
```

Set managed mode:
```
$ sudo iw wlan0 set type managed
```

Bring the interface up:
```
$ sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```

Verify the mode has changed:
```
$ sudo iw dev
```

### USB 3 Support

I have included a file called `88x2bu.conf` that
will be installed in `/etc/modeprob.d` by default.

`88x2bu.conf` passes a parameter to the driver
during boot that turns USB 3 mode on. The
difference in performance can be large as can
be seen in the data from the tests that I
conducted:

```
88x2bu without `88x2bu.conf`
 (average Bitrate = 255 Mbits/sec)

Interval           Transfer     Bitrate
1.00-2.00   sec  30.9 MBytes   260 Mbits/sec
2.00-3.00   sec  29.5 MBytes   247 Mbits/sec
3.00-4.00   sec  32.6 MBytes   273 Mbits/sec
4.00-5.00   sec  30.6 MBytes   256 Mbits/sec
5.00-6.00   sec  30.4 MBytes   255 Mbits/sec
6.00-7.00   sec  28.3 MBytes   238 Mbits/sec
```

```
88x2bu with `88x2bu.conf`
 (average Bitrate = 411 Mbits/sec)

Interval           Transfer     Bitrate
1.00-2.00   sec  48.8 MBytes   409 Mbits/sec
2.00-3.00   sec  47.5 MBytes   398 Mbits/sec
3.00-4.00   sec  51.2 MBytes   430 Mbits/sec
4.00-5.00   sec  48.8 MBytes   409 Mbits/sec
5.00-6.00   sec  50.0 MBytes   419 Mbits/sec
6.00-7.00   sec  47.5 MBytes   398 Mbits/sec
```

That is a 62% increase in performance!

See what your USB mode is:

```
$ lsusb -t
```

USB 2 =  480M
USB 3 = 5000M

Note: If there is a problem, delete `88x2bu.conf`.
