# /etc/modprobe.d/88x2bu.conf
#
# Purpose: Turn on USB3 support
#
# Place this file in /etc/modprobe.d
#
options 88x2bu rtw_switch_usb_mode=1
#
# Note: The driver is supposed to come up and start
# in USB 2 mode and switch up... but it doesn't.
#
# (USB 2 bandwidth is only 480Mbps thus limiting
#  throughput to around 240Mbps.)
